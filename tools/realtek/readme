notes on installing new version of r8169 driver,
to support Itox motherboard

if you have the right .ko file, like this:
$CROB_HOME/tools/realtek/v6.10/r8169.ko.v6.10, just put it here:

/lib/modules/2.6.15(or wherever)/kernel/drivers/net/r8169.ko

if you need to compile a new .ko, read on.

i got the RTL8110SC(L) Linux driver package from realtek.com

r8169-6.010.00.tar.bz2

LINUX driver for kernel 2.6.x and 2.4.X (support x86 and x64)
Version 6.010.00
Date 2009/5/5
Size 29k

http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=4&PFid=4&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false&Downloads=true#RTL8110SC(L)

(if you try to download a newer one, it might have a newer version number.)

untar the archive with tar xvfj.

note that the src directory from the tar might have bad ownership and
modes (so you can't read it), which you can fix with chown and chmod.

to compile the driver, go to to the net driver directory
in your linux kernel source tree:

cd trunk/linux-2.6.15/drivers/net/

move the existing r8169.c and r8169.h aside.
copy the .h and .c files from the src subdirectory to this dir

i changed the name of the source file from r8169_n.c to r8169.c,
to mimic what was already in the Linux tree, so the makefile would
work unchanged.

-rw-r--r--   1 trb  trb  103389 2009-04-13 02:30 r8169.c
-rw-r--r--   1 trb  trb   29896 2009-04-13 02:45 r8169.h

cd trunk/linux-2.6.15
and run:

make drivers/net/r8169.ko

it's good to make it in place, in case there are funky Xenomai
dependencies in there (I'm not clear on this).

it prints some warnings like so, should be safe:

it makes the following:

-rw-r--r--   1 root root  39690 2009-05-06 12:43 r8169.ko

copy the new r8169.ko to

/lib/modules/2.6.15-interactive-motion.1500/kernel/drivers/net/

and load it with modprobe or by rebooting.

when you run network-admin, it should now show an eth0 ethernet connection.
activate it and it should work.

if it's working, dmesg should print something like:

r8169 Gigabit Ethernet driver 6.010.00 loaded
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:01:0b.0[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
r8169: This product is covered by one or more of the following patents: US5,307,459, US5,434,872, US5,732,094, US6,570,884, US6,115,776, and US6,327,625.
eth0: RTL8169SC/8110SC at 0xf8b7a000, 00:01:29:a4:da:da, IRQ 18

if not, it should print clues.
